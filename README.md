# Football Forum and Merchandise Website

This is a **Football Forum and Merchandise Website** built using **React**. It is designed for football enthusiasts to engage in discussions, share their opinions, and shop for exclusive football merchandise.

## About the Project

The project showcases my skills in **React** by creating an interactive web application. The platform combines a discussion forum and an e-commerce section, allowing users to both participate in conversations about football and shop for related merchandise.

## Features
